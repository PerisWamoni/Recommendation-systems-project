## Business Understanding 
In today's digital age, streaming platforms are becoming increasingly popular. With the vast amount of content available, users often find it challenging to discover movies that align with their preferences. This leads to decision paralysis, where users spend more time searching for content than actually consuming it. For a new streaming platform, ViewHapa, the challenge is to provide personalized movie recommendations to its users, ensuring they spend more time watching and less time searching, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.
